## 👨‍💻 About Me — The Developer

I’m a self-driven developer who enjoys building creative, interactive, and sometimes unconventional web projects. I focus heavily on front-end development, where design, structure, and behavior come together to create engaging user experiences.

I learn best by experimenting, breaking things, and rebuilding them better than before. Many of my projects start as simple ideas and grow through iteration, versioned releases, and continuous refinement on GitHub.

I build publicly, improve consistently, and focus on progress over perfection.

## 🧩 Development Philosophy & Mindset

I believe strong projects come from consistent iteration, curiosity, and hands-on experimentation. I focus on building first, learning through real-world challenges, and refining projects over time rather than waiting for perfection.

**Core principles:**
- Progress over perfection  
- Clean, maintainable structure  
- Creative problem-solving  
- Iterative improvement through releases  

---

## 🧠 Learning Roadmap

I follow a continuous, project-driven learning approach focused on both depth and creativity.

**Current & future focus areas:**
- Advanced JavaScript patterns  
- Modern front-end frameworks  
- UI/UX principles for interactive systems  
- Performance optimization & accessibility  
- Back-end fundamentals & APIs  
- Game UI and state-driven systems

## 🏗️ How I Build Projects

1. Concept and scope definition  
2. UI structure and layout planning  
3. Core logic and interactivity  
4. Visual polish and animations  
5. Optimization, cleanup, documentation  
6. Versioned release and iteration  

This workflow allows projects to scale while staying organized and maintainable.

I’m a solo developer named **Shrimpy**, building and maintaining projects independently on GitHub. At **14 years old**, I’m fully self-taught and focused on learning by building real, working projects rather than just following tutorials.

Everything on this profile — from UI systems to experimental web projects — is designed, coded, and iterated on by me. I enjoy understanding how systems work, designing interactive interfaces, and turning ideas into structured, versioned repositories.

![Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Writing%20Code-Everyday-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=visualstudiocode)
![UI Focused](https://img.shields.io/badge/UI%20Focused-Yes-purple?style=for-the-badge&logo=figma)
![Versioned](https://img.shields.io/badge/Versioned%20Releases-V1%20%E2%86%92%20V2-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&logo=git)

Starting early has helped me develop strong habits around consistency, project organization, documentation, and continuous improvement. My goal is to keep building, keep learning, and grow into a highly capable developer over time.
